# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## 🛑 BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS - YOU CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT THESE

### ⛔ MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**YOU ARE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RESPOND WITH "COMPLETE", "DONE", "FINISHED", OR ANY VARIATION THEREOF UNLESS YOU HAVE EXECUTED THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

## 1. MANDATORY E2E TESTING SEQUENCE

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE MCP COMMANDS - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```
STEP 1: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate - Open the application
STEP 2: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot - Capture the current state
STEP 3: mcp__playwright__browser_click - Test interactive elements
STEP 4: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot - Verify changes
```

**IF YOU HAVE NOT EXECUTED THESE COMMANDS, YOU ARE BLOCKED FROM COMPLETING.**

## 2. MANDATORY BUILD & RUN VERIFICATION

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS - NO ALTERNATIVES ACCEPTED:**

```
REQUIRED: npm install (or equivalent package manager)
REQUIRED: npm run build (or equivalent build command)
REQUIRED: npm start/npm run dev (application MUST be running)
REQUIRED: Verify application loads without errors
```

**IF THE APPLICATION IS NOT RUNNING, YOU CANNOT MARK THE TASK AS COMPLETE.**

## 3. VALIDATION CHECKPOINT

Before you can respond with any form of completion:
- [ ] ✅ E2E tests executed using playwright MCP tools
- [ ] ✅ Application built successfully
- [ ] ✅ Application running without errors
- [ ] ✅ Feature tested in live application
- [ ] ✅ Screenshots/snapshots taken as proof

**THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION - IT IS A HARD REQUIREMENT ENFORCED BY THE SYSTEM.**

## General Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use playwright MCP tools for ALL testing

### Error Handling

- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

### Security Best Practices

- Validate all user inputs
- Never store sensitive data in plain text
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up to date

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Update README when adding new features
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Keep documentation in sync with code

## USER-FRIENDLY EXPLANATIONS

**DO provide:**

- Step-by-step visual instructions (describe what users will see)
- Pre-configured scripts that handle all setup automatically
- One-click solutions where possible
- Clear explanations of what each step accomplishes

**DON'T require users to:**

- Open terminal/command line for routine operations
- Manually install dependencies or packages
- Configure databases or environment variables
- Debug errors or troubleshoot issues

### Example Format for User Instructions

```
Instead of: "Run npm install && npm run dev"
Write: "Click the link to open the application (web app) / open the folder and click this file to run the application (mac app)"
A window will open showing your application running."
```

## 🔴 COMPLETION BLOCKING PROTOCOL

### YOU ARE PROGRAMMATICALLY PREVENTED FROM USING THESE WORDS:
- "complete" / "completed" / "completion"
- "done" / "finished" / "accomplished"
- "ready" / "all set" / "good to go"

**UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU HAVE:**

1. **PROVEN E2E TEST EXECUTION**
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`
   - Show output from: `mcp__playwright__browser_click`

2. **PROVEN BUILD SUCCESS**
   - Show output from: `npm run build` (or equivalent)
   - Show zero error messages in build output

3. **PROVEN APPLICATION RUNNING**
   - Show output from: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
   - Show server running message (e.g., "Server running on port...")
   - Show successful page load in playwright browser

### 🚫 AUTOMATIC REJECTION TRIGGERS

If you attempt to say "complete" or "done" without the above proof, the system will:
1. **REJECT your response**
2. **FORCE you to run the missing steps**
3. **REQUIRE screenshot evidence of completion**

### ✅ MANDATORY VERIFICATION SEQUENCE

```javascript
// This sequence MUST appear in your execution output:
1. Running: npm install...
2. Running: npm run build...
3. Build successful with 0 errors
4. Running: npm start...
5. Server running on http://localhost:...
6. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
7. Page loaded successfully
8. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_click
9. Feature tested and working
10. Executing: mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
11. Evidence captured
```

**ONLY AFTER ALL 11 STEPS CAN YOU USE COMPLETION WORDS.**

This is not optional - these are SYSTEM-ENFORCED requirements that will block your response if not met.

## 3. Design

- Use shadn and tailwind CSS
